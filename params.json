{"name":"Icnscomposer","tagline":"Create icns for OS X.","body":"# Icns Composer #\r\n\r\nIf you're like me, you love the high quality icons OS X provides. And you probably like to create your own icons for one or another app. Since Apple doesn't support 1024x1024 retina images with 'Icon Composer' anymore, at least as far as I know, I decided to create a small app that does. __Icns Composer__. You can simply drag and drop your image onto Icns Composer, just like you did with Apple's Icon Composer, and click Export.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Looking for a way to create Xcode image assets? ####\r\nYou want to create Xcode image assets (*.xcassets)?
